# Wordle Clone with Python and Rich

Tier: 1-Beginner

Wordle, a popular word guessing game, was launched in October 2021 and has since been enjoyed by millions. It's a web-based game where players guess a five-letter word in six attempts. In this project, you'll recreate Wordle as a command-line application using Python and the Rich library to enhance its appearance.

Here's a list of the corresponding components of Wordle and their values:

- Correct letters - Green
- Misplaced letters - Yellow
- Wrong letters - Gray

## User Stories

- Users should be able to input a guess word.
- Users should see the result after each guess, with the correct, misplaced, and wrong letters marked.
- If a user inputs a word of incorrect length, they should be shown an error message and be allowed to guess again.

## Project Overview

The project's main goal is to iteratively develop a Wordle clone using the following steps:

1. Develop a basic prototype that allows users to guess a secret word and provides feedback on the accuracy of the guess.
2. Enhance the game by including a word list from which the game randomly selects the secret word.
3. Refactor the code to use functions for better organization and readability.
4. Improve the game's appearance using the Rich library.
5. Provide users with helpful feedback when they play the game.
6. Improve the user interface by displaying the status of all the letters in the alphabet.

## Bonus features

- Automatic feedback on user input.
- Validation of words guessed by the user.
- Stylish game wrap-up.
