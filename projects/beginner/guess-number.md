# Guess number

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Write a program that selects a number between a and b and you try to guess the selected number by giving a numerical input to the program. If your guess is correct, the message that your guess is correct will be written in the console and the program will end, otherwise the program will continue until you guess correctly.

Imagine you are A and the computer is C. The number the program has chosen is 12 for example:

```
C:
    Guess number: 
A:
    20
C:
    Wrong
    Guess another:
A:
    34
C:
    Wrong
    Guess another:
A:
    12
C:
    !!!!!YES!!!!!
```

## Bonus features
You can do something so that you can guess only n times with each execution of your program, and if your guesses are unsuccessful every n times, the program will be closed by displaying a message.
